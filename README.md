Spring 2020 Java 212

Write a Java program that will 

1. Ask the user to type in a sentence, using a JOptionPane.showInputDialog().

2. The program will examine each letter in the string and count how many time the upper-case letter 'E' appears, and how many times the lower-case letter 'e' appears. The key here is to use the charAt method in class String.

3. Using a JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(), tell the user how many upper and lower case e's were in the string.

4. Repeat this process until the user types the word "Stop". (Check out the method equalsIgnoreCase in class String to cover all upper/lower case possibilities of the word "STOP").
