Spring 2020 Java 212

Project1, ClockGUI, and Clock are all part of the same project. The assignment for this code is below

Create a class called Clock to represent a Clock. It should have three private instance variables:
An int for the hours, an int for the minutes, and an int for the seconds.
The class should include a threeargument constructor and get and set methods for each instance variable. 
Override the method toString which should return the Clock information in the same format as the input file (See below). 
 
Read the information about a Clock from a file that will be given to you on Blackboard,
parse out the three pieces of information for the Clock using a StringTokenizer, 
instantiate the Clock and store the Clock object in two different arrays (one of these arrays will be sorted in a later step). 
Once the file has been read and the arrays have been filled, sort one of the arrays by hours using Selection Sort. 
 
Display the contents of the arrays in a GUI that has a GridLayout with one row and two columns. 
The left column should display the Clocks in the order read from the file, and the right column should display the Clocks in sorted order.
